# GcalDemo - Apple Calendar Integration 🍎📅

Ciao! This app now supports both Google Calendar and Apple Calendar integration with full CRUD operations!

## What I Fixed for Apple Calendar 🔧

1. **Added Calendar Usage Description** - Added `NSCalendarsUsageDescription` to Info.plist so iOS knows why the app needs calendar access
2. **Fixed EventKitManager Integration** - Made the `isFullAccessAuthorized` method public so the AppleCalendarViewModel can use it properly
3. **Improved CalendarSettings** - Fixed the @Published property binding for better UI updates
4. **Cleaned up AppleCalendarViewModel** - Removed unnecessary extension and fixed method calls
5. **Fixed ForEach ID Issue** - Resolved duplicate ID warnings by using enumerated indices instead of potentially duplicate eventIdentifiers
6. **Added Full CRUD Operations** - Implemented Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for Apple Calendar events
7. **Custom Event Forms** - Created beautiful custom forms for adding and editing Apple Calendar events
8. **Added EventFormMode Enum** - Proper enum for handling add vs edit modes

## How to Use Apple Calendar 📱

1. **Launch the app** - Open GcalDemo on your iOS device or simulator
2. **Select Apple Calendar** - Use the segmented picker at the top to switch from "Google Calendar" to "Apple Calendar"
3. **Grant Permission** - When prompted, tap "Request Calendar Access" and allow the app to access your calendar
4. **View Events** - Your upcoming Apple Calendar events will be displayed
5. **Add Events** - Tap the "+" button to create new events with custom forms
6. **Edit Events** - Tap on any event to edit its details using the custom edit form
7. **Delete Events** - Swipe left on events to delete them
